## Welcome to the Little Green Barn website

Hi Teachers and Classmates of Trinity. I started this website for my 8th Grade Civics project at Trinity.

## My Plan

My plan is to create some useful content to help my classmates become better Green Energy Citizens in the form of documents and creating Blog posts as I think of interesting things to chat about.

## Docusaurus

My dad helped me put this site together using a *Static Site Generator* called *Docusaurus*. It lets me write basic blog posts in a text editor and it magically converts it to web pages.
