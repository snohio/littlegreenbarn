## Information about Energy 

> ### What is an energy community?
>
> In a nutshell, an energy community is a group of people, for instance residents in a neighbourhood, who cooperate in energy actions such as generating, storing, consuming or selling the community’s own energy. For example, they can buy an electric car for joint use or build solar panels on roofs. Energy communities can be localized or virtual.
>
> ### Here’s an example!
>
> Even though we talk about the power of communities, individual lifestyle choices matter, too. In fact, there’s still a lot you can do, even if you are not part of an energy community.
>
> Energy citizenship means that us citizens can actively participate in energy systems and have a positive impact on the energy transition. This can take many forms, from using energy-saving appliances, opting for renewable energy solutions, using electric vehicles to participating for instance in climate change demonstrations. Energy communities are one form of active energy citizenship.

> In GRETA, we conducted a multinational survey with 10,000 participants in the EU and identified eight different types of energy citizens in the EU. To get you equipped with concrete and easy actions in your everyday life, take a quiz and get personal tips on how to use energy more sustainably!
