## From the United Nations on Climate Action

> ### Renewable energy – powering a safer future
>
> Energy is at the heart of the climate challenge – and key to the solution.
>
> A large chunk of the greenhouse gases that blanket the Earth and trap the sun’s heat are generated through energy production, by burning fossil fuels to generate electricity and heat.
>
> Fossil fuels, such as coal, oil and gas, are by far the largest contributor to global climate change, accounting for over 75 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions and nearly 90 percent of all carbon dioxide emissions.
>
> The science is clear: to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, emissions need to be reduced by almost half by 2030 and reach net-zero by 2050.
>
> To achieve this, we need to end our reliance on fossil fuels and invest in alternative sources of energy that are clean, accessible, affordable, sustainable, and reliable.
>
> Renewable energy sources – which are available in abundance all around us, provided by the sun, wind, water, waste, and heat from the Earth – are replenished by nature and emit little to no greenhouse gases or pollutants into the air.
>
> Fossil fuels still account for more than 80 percent of global energy production, but cleaner sources of energy are gaining ground. About 29 percent of electricity currently comes from renewable sources.

## Why the United Nations information on Renewal Energy is important to become a Green Energy Citizen

It talks about the benefits of renewable energy. It will be helpful because we can put it on our website so people can access it and learn about the facts. This will be used in presenting because it is a reliable source.
